Neuron TODO for Debian packaging

* Verify/collect legal terms

* Decide where to ship whatever is provided in share/{examples,demo}

Upstream:

* Remove executable flags from files (commit in hg), or ...

* Why not add a '#!/usr/bin/env neuron' shebang for .ses/.hoc files (which
  are made executable now for no reason) -- check which ones ;)
