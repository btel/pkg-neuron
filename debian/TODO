Neuron Packaging TODO

Debian
======

* Verify/collect legal terms

* Decide where to ship whatever is provided in share/{examples,demo}

* InterViews -- clarify situation and possible extension of ivtools
  with missing pieces

* Python module -- build for all supported versions and and ship in
  appropriate 

* nrnmech_makefile  is not place in /usr/bin -- share/nrn ??

* should demo get a separate package?
  for now in neuron-common

* memacs?  ng seems to be similar... but not the same
  --without-memacs   ?

*  /usr/bin/modlunit  relies on ./share/lib/nrnunits.lib

* MPI builds

* share/lib/python/rdxml.py
  from neuroml -- might want separate packaging


Upstream
========

* Remove executable flags from files -- commit in hg

  http://bitbucket.org/yarikoptic/nrn/changeset/c8ef3b231822

  might need to be refined since does for .sh.in as well

* Scripts shipped under usr/bin/ should not have extensions (e.g. .sh)
  since implementation language does not matter and accounted for
  with proper shebangs in teh files

* *_makefile should not be shipped under */bin/ since they are not
  executable.  Could they be shipped under */share/neuron/ and used
  from there ?

* Why not add a '#!/usr/bin/env neuron' shebang for .ses/.hoc files (which
  are made executable now for no reason) -- check which ones ;)

* --without-mpi in configure has no effect -- so everything builds
   using mpicc for no good reason
