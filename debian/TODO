Neuron Packaging TODO

Debian
======

* Verify/collect legal terms

* Decide where to ship whatever is provided in share/{examples,demo}

* InterViews -- clarify situation and possible extension of ivtools
  with missing pieces

* Python module -- build for all supported versions and and ship in
  appropriate 

* nrnmech_makefile  is not place in /usr/bin -- share/nrn ??

* should demo get a separate package?
  for now in neuron-common

- memacs?  ng seems to be similar... but not the same
  --without-memacs   ?

*  /usr/bin/modlunit  relies on ./share/lib/nrnunits.lib

* MPI builds

* share/lib/python/rdxml.py
  from neuroml -- might want separate packaging

* Unknown origin/copyright/license holders:

  src/e_editor -- "Modified by Dennis Rockwell and David Leonard for phs"

* Inspect viability to rely on existing in Debian?

  src/gnu
  src/memacs

  src/mac   -- strip non-free (see below) -- mac-specific
  src/mesch -- libmeschach1.2, libmeschach-dev

  * but has some NEURON bits, e.g
+   if ( ! err_list[list_num].warn )  {
+#ifdef NEURON
+       hoc_execerror("meschach library error", (char*)0);
+#else
+       exit(0);
+#endif
+   }

and "fixes?" like
-    if ( from < to )
+    if ( from >= to )

-               while ( d->ve[--j] < v )
+               while ( i < j && d->ve[--j] < v )

+       if (f == VNULL && limit == 1) { /* some calloc's do not allow 0 size */
+               f = v_resize(f, limit);
+       }


  * and some files are missing, e.g. src/mesch/iotort.c
  * and #include <../../nrnconf.h> all around

  src/mswin -- strip non-free -- windowss-pecific

* Is any binary from interviews (e.g. idraw, idemo, iclass) necessary?

Upstream
========

* Remove executable flags from files -- commit in hg

  http://bitbucket.org/yarikoptic/nrn/changeset/c8ef3b231822

  might need to be refined since does for .sh.in as well

* Scripts shipped under usr/bin/ should not have extensions (e.g. .sh)
  since implementation language does not matter and accounted for
  with proper shebangs in teh files

* *_makefile should not be shipped under */bin/ since they are not
  executable.  Could they be shipped under */share/neuron/ and used
  from there ?

* Why not add a '#!/usr/bin/env neuron' shebang for .ses/.hoc files (which
  are made executable now for no reason) -- check which ones ;)

* --without-mpi in configure has no effect -- so everything builds
   using mpicc for no good reason

* Some code is under GPL-3+, which automagically boosts your license
  for the complete product to version 3
