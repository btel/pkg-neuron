Neuron TODO for Debian packaging

* Verify/collect legal terms

* Decide where to ship whatever is provided in share/{examples,demo}

* InterViews -- clarify situation and possible extension of ivtools
  with missing pieces

* Python module -- build for all supported versions and and ship in
  appropriate location


Upstream:

* Remove executable flags from files (commit in hg), or ...

* Consult upstream about .sh scripts shipped under usr/bin/

* Why not add a '#!/usr/bin/env neuron' shebang for .ses/.hoc files (which
  are made executable now for no reason) -- check which ones ;)
