Neuron TODO for Debian packaging

* Verify/collect legal terms

* Decide where to ship whatever is provided in share/{examples,demo}

* InterViews -- clarify situation and possible extension of ivtools
  with missing pieces

* Python module -- build for all supported versions and and ship in
  appropriate 

* nrnmech_makefile  is not place in /usr/bin -- share/nrn
   referrs also to 
 
* should demo get a separate package?

* memacs?  ng seems to be similar... but not the same
  --without-memacs   ?

*  /usr/bin/modlunit  relies on ./share/lib/nrnunits.lib

* MPI builds

Upstream:

* Remove executable flags from files (commit in hg), or ...

* Consult upstream about .sh scripts shipped under usr/bin/

* Why not add a '#!/usr/bin/env neuron' shebang for .ses/.hoc files (which
  are made executable now for no reason) -- check which ones ;)

* --without-mpi has no effect
